## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- 7df69248: Refactors the Toggle component to resolve bugs, improve maintainability, and improve accessibility for sighted and non-sighted users.

  - Refactors the internal DOM structure of the component to be as accessible as possible, and uses the appropriate role.
  - Restructures how the styles are structured in the component to improve maintainability.
  - Slightly increases contrast of the "ON" and "OFF" labels in the default size to meet WCAG AA contrast guidelines.
  - Hides the "ON" and "OFF" labels for screen readers so that only the current state of the Toggle is read.
  - Enforces use of `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` so that Toggles always have screen reader accessible text associated with them.
  - Fixes a bug with the rendering of the focus state on Windows machines.
  - Uses the LeafyGreen Provider to conditionally show the focus state based on how the user is interacting with the page.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7df69248]
  - @leafygreen-ui/lib@6.2.0

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8b0ea602: Removed `interactionRingSize` prop. Previously the interaction ring could cause the toggle to overflow its container. Since the interaction ring is now based on box-shadows, this should no longer be necessary.
- 8b0ea602: Form-compatible components now display more visually consistent hover and focus states

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8b0ea602]
  - @leafygreen-ui/interaction-ring@1.0.0

## 5.0.2

### Patch Changes

- ee7923d3: Changes how we extend the types of HTMLElements, and standardizes how we document this across readmes

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- dac3f38b: Fixes a publishing error that prevented UMD modules from being distributed
- Updated dependencies [dac3f38b]
  - @leafygreen-ui/lib@6.0.1
  - @leafygreen-ui/palette@3.0.1

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0267bfd2: The underlying structure of distributed module definition files have changed and now have official support for ES modules. Module definition files are now generated using Rollup instead of Webpack. This should not affect functionality, but some thorough testing and caution should be exercised when upgrading.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0267bfd2]
  - @leafygreen-ui/lib@6.0.0
  - @leafygreen-ui/palette@3.0.0

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 6e210765: The tooltip's notch now appears at more appropriate positions for smaller trigger elements.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 24af55cc: Addresses issue where Toggle caused scrollbars to appear in certain environments. This should no longer happen by default; however, if the focus state still causes the scrollbars to appear, this version adds an export, `interactionRingSize`, which is a value that can be applied to the margin of the container wrapping Toggle, and in turn prevent the focus state from overflowing.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- b863e502: Refactors Toggle from class-based to functional component, and deprecates `variant` in favor of new `darkMode` prop to control whether or not the component appears in dark mode
