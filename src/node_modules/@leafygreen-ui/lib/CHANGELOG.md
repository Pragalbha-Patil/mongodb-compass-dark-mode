## 6.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7df69248: Refactors the Toggle component to resolve bugs, improve maintainability, and improve accessibility for sighted and non-sighted users.

  - Refactors the internal DOM structure of the component to be as accessible as possible, and uses the appropriate role.
  - Restructures how the styles are structured in the component to improve maintainability.
  - Slightly increases contrast of the "ON" and "OFF" labels in the default size to meet WCAG AA contrast guidelines.
  - Hides the "ON" and "OFF" labels for screen readers so that only the current state of the Toggle is read.
  - Enforces use of `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` so that Toggles always have screen reader accessible text associated with them.
  - Fixes a bug with the rendering of the focus state on Windows machines.
  - Uses the LeafyGreen Provider to conditionally show the focus state based on how the user is interacting with the page.
