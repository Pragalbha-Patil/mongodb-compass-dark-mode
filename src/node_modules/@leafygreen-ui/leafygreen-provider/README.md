# LeafyGreen Provider

![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@leafygreen-ui/leafygreen-provider.svg)

LeafyGreen Provider is a package made to provide, and make it easy to consume page-wide, interaction-related state within components, such as whether a user is navigating with a keyboard or mouse. This lets us make improvements to the user experience that would be cumbersome, or impossible to make without access to a global state.

Components should always gracefully degrade when the provider is not an ancestor. Please implement these APIs with that in mind.

## Installation

### Yarn

```shell
yarn add @leafygreen-ui/leafygreen-provider
```

### NPM

```shell
npm install @leafygreen-ui/leafygreen-provider
```

## LeafyGreenProvider

This is the context provider for LeafyGreen Provider, and should be added as high in the document tree as possible.

### Example

#### Input

```js
import LeafyGreenProvider from '@leafygreen-ui/leafygreen-provider';

<LeafyGreenProvider>
  <div>My Children</div>
</LeafyGreenProvider>;
```

#### Output

```html
<div>My Children</div>
```

### Properties

| Prop           | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                               | Default |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `children`     | `node`     | Children passed to `LeafyGreenProvider` will be unmodified, aside from having access to its state.                                                                                        |         |
| `baseFontSize` | `14`, `16` | Describes the `font-size` that the application is using. `<Body/>` and `<InlineCode />` components use this value to determine the `font-size` and `line-height` applied to their content | `14`    |

## useUsingKeyboardContext

**Returns:**

```js
{
  usingKeyboard: boolean | undefined,
  setUsingKeyboard: boolean => void,
}
```

This hook allows you to directly read, and set the state of whether a user is interacting with the keyboard. The primary use-case for this is to set `usingKeyboard` to `true` when manually setting focus on an element.

### Example

```js
import { useUsingKeyboardContext } from '@leafygreen-ui/leafygreen-provider';

const { usingKeyboard, setUsingKeyboard } = useUsingKeyboardContext();
const inputRef = useRef(null);

function autoFocus() {
  inputRef.current?.focus();

  if (!usingKeyboard) {
    setUsingKeyboard(true);
  }
}

<input type={text} ref={inputRef} />;
```

## useBaseFontSize

**Returns:**

```js
`number`;
```

This hook allows you to read the base `font-size` of an application, based on the number returned from the hook.

### Example

```js
import { useBaseFontSize } from '@leafygreen-ui/leafygreen-provider';

function InlineCode({ children, className }: InlineCodeProps) {
  const size = useBaseFontSize();
  const body = size === 16 ? typeScale2 : typeScale1;

  return (
    <code className={cx(sharedStyles, code, body, className)}>{children}</code>
  );
}
```
